# Web Schema v1.0

Web Schema is an open source tool created to make it easier for webmasters to markup their content with a collection of [schemas](http://schema.org/).

The tool has been created as a plugin for TinyMCE but will look into supporting other WYSIWYG editors in the future.

## Requirements
*	TinyMCE
*	PHP
*	MYSQL
*	Wordpress

## Installation

At the moment, the tool is only available for Wordpress but I'll be working on a Drupal version very soon.

### Wordpress

All you have to do is pull the source code and add it to the plugin directory. Once that's done the plugin needs to be activated in the plugin admin interface.

##	How to use
The tool can be used on any page that contains a TinyMCE editor.

To add a schema to a piece of content, just select the content and click on the 'Add/Edit Schema' button on the editor.
This will provide you with an interface where you can create a schema for that content


### Highlighting.
To make it easier to identify each schema, all marked-up content are highlighted and a tooltip is shown when the mouse moves over the highlighted content. Below is a list of colors used
to highlight each markup.

*	Type - <font color="#FFCC80">Baby Yellow</font>
*	Property - <font color="#CCFFFF">Baby Green</font>

##	TODO
*	Drupal version
*	Standalone version
*	Develop functionality to add custom schemas
